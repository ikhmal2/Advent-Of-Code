# Advent of Code

This project is my attempt at completing the Advent of Code challenge for 25 days using TypeScript.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual coding challenge that takes place in December. Each day, a new coding puzzle is released and participants are challenged to solve it using their programming skills. The puzzles range in difficulty and cover a variety of topics, from algorithms and data structures to cryptography and game theory.

## About This Project

In this project, I will be using TypeScript to solve the Advent of Code puzzles. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features to the language. It is designed to make large-scale JavaScript applications more manageable and easier to maintain.

## Folder Structure

Each day's puzzle will be located in its own folder, named `day_XX`, where `XX` is the day number. Inside each folder, there will be a `README.md` file with the puzzle description and a `index.ts` file with my TypeScript solution.
